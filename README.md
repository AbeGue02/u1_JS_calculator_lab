# JS DOM Calculator Lab

For this lab we will be taking our HTML, CSS, and JS to build up a functioning calculator. This calculator should have at least Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, and Division functions, with the ability to clear out your screen and reset your values



## Requirements

- A functioning JS calculator with at least 4 Mathematic functions. 
- Buttons for numbers 0-9, your math functions, and the ability to clear your screen
- Beautiful, professional styling using CSS Grid or Flexbox
- A button to make a number Negative

## Tips

- Start simple, get one function before working with all of them. Get the basic 4 working before doing Square Roots, Exponents, or any other math functions you may want to try (Sine, Cos, Tan...)
- Use Grid or Flexbox to style your calculator buttons in a clean way
- Console Log is going to be your friend, use it often!
